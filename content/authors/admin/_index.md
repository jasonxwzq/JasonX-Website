I am an applied economist and a Ph.D. candidate at University of California, Davis. My research interest lies in the intersection of agricultural economics and development economics, with a special focus on the impact of climate change on agricultural production in the developing world. I am now working under the guidance of Prof. Richard J. Sexton and Prof. Stephen R. Boucher.
